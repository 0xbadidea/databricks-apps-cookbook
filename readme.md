## üìñ Databricks Apps Cookbook

This cookbook provides reusable examples for building interactive data [Apps](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/databricks-apps/index.html) on Databricks. [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)'s pre-built Python components simplify creating intuitive interfaces for data exploration and operations:

With these recipes, you‚Äôll learn how to:
- **Connect UIs to Databricks resources** like workflows, pipelines, users, and volumes.  
- **Interact and edit** tables in-app for real-time data manipulation.  
- **Extend** examples to other Apps-supported frameworks, like Dash, Flask, Gradio, and Shiny.  

We encourage you to **combine examples**‚Äîsuch as triggering workflows when a table is edited.

### üç≥ Instructions
1. [Fork this repo](https://docs.github.com/de/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo).
2. [Load the repo as a Databricks Git folder](https://docs.databricks.com/en/repos/index.html).
3. Deploy the cookbook App:
   - Use the _Custom_ option in the [Databricks Apps UI](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/databricks-apps/app-development.html#how-do-i-create-an-app-in-the-databricks-apps-ui), or  
   - Deploy via [Databricks CLI](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/databricks-apps/get-started.html#step-4-deploy-the-app-to-your-workspace).
4. Review the **Setup** tab for any recipe you wish to try as some recipes require additional steps before running. 
5. Once ready, explore the **Try** tab for a user-facing implementation or dive into the **Implement** tab for full integration code with extension references:
